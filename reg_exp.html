            let string="JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for creating interactive effects within web browsers. It was developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich and has since become one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript enables developers to implement complex features such as dynamic content updates, animations, form validations, and handling user events. It is a client-side language, meaning code is executed directly in the user's browser, which helps improve the responsiveness of web applications. Besides the browser, JavaScript also runs on servers via environments like Node.js, making it popular for full-stack development. Its syntax is influenced by languages like Java and C, but it is dynamically typed and supports prototype-based object orientation.";
